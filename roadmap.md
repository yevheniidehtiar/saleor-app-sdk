Summary & Recommendation
Yes, creating an OSS Python SDK for Saleor apps is absolutely worth it and makes complete sense! Here's why:
ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Benefits

Developer Ecosystem Growth: Python is huge in e-commerce, data science, and automation
Reduced Friction: No more TypeScript bridges or hybrid architectures
Community Impact: Would attract Python developers to Saleor ecosystem
Future-Proof: As Saleor grows, having native SDKs for major languages is essential

ðŸ”¥ Technical Advantages

FastAPI + HTMX = Perfect Match: Server-rendered interactivity without complex frontend builds
Better Developer Experience: Native Python tooling, testing, debugging
Performance: Async throughout, efficient GraphQL handling
Maintainability: Single language stack, easier to debug and extend

ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy
Phase 1 (MVP - 2-3 months):

Core SDK with FastAPI integration
Basic templates (webhook, UI, basic)
CLI tool for app creation
Documentation and examples

Phase 2 (Community Growth - 3-6 months):

Advanced storage backends
More app templates
Testing utilities and CI/CD tools
Community contributions

Phase 3 (Ecosystem - 6+ months):

Plugin system
Marketplace integration
Advanced monitoring/analytics
Enterprise features

ðŸ“ˆ Community Impact
This would be the foundational dependency for all Python Saleor apps. Similar to how:

@saleor/app-sdk is for TypeScript apps
Django is for Django projects
FastAPI is for FastAPI apps

Bottom Line: Creating saleor-app-sdk-python would:

Dramatically lower the barrier for Python developers
Establish the standard for Python Saleor apps
Grow the Saleor ecosystem significantly
Position you as a leader in the Saleor community

I'd say go for it! The Python community would definitely embrace this, and it fills a real gap in the Saleor ecosystem. Want me to help you plan the initial release strategy or dive deeper into any specific component?
